"""
Wago Scale Test — End-to-End Cross-Worker Verification

Tests the full scale-up and scale-down lifecycle:
1. Baseline: verify clean state
2. Fill worker 1 (50 connections)
3. Trigger scale-up (create connection 51+)
4. Verify 2 workers active
5. Delete connections to trigger scale-down
6. Verify back to 1 worker
7. Verify Hetzner nodes cleaned up

Usage:
